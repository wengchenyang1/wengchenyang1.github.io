        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This privacy policy applies to the mobile application provided by Chenyang Weng (hereby referred to as
            "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>The application may collect data, but it is only saved on the user's device. The application does not
            collect, store, or share any data externally. Users have full control over their data, including the ability
            to manage, delete, or share the data. The data will be wiped out if the user deletes the app.</p>

        <h2>Third Party Access</h2>
        <p>The application does not utilize third-party services that collect data. We do not share any user information
            with third parties.</p>

        <h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>
        <p>You can stop using the application at any time by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall
            processes available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect any user data externally, there is no data retention policy applicable. All data is
            stored locally on the user's device and can be managed by the user.</p>

        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>The application does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally
            identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. However, since we do not collect
            any data externally, there are no specific security measures applicable.</p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes by
            updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for
            any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>

        <h2>Your Consent</h2>
        <p>By using the application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this
            Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.</p>
