        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This privacy policy applies to the mobile application provided by Chenyang Weng (hereby referred to as
            "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>This application utilizes the device's front-facing TrueDepth camera to collect depth map and RGB image data.
            Specifically, the application accesses raw pixel data from the RGB camera, and depth information as provided
            by the TrueDepth API. The collected depth map and RGB image data are processed exclusively for the following
            purposes: 3D Model Generation and Real-time Camera Preview. This data is not used for any other purposes,
            including but not limited to, facial recognition, biometric identification, or marketing. All captured
            photographic data, including depth maps and RGB image frames, are stored solely on the user's local device.
            This data is not transmitted to external servers or shared with any third parties. The user retains complete
            control over the generated 3D models. The user has the option to share the generated 3D models, however, the
            original captured images and depth maps are not made available for sharing outside of the device's local
            storage. All data stored by this application is permanently deleted from the device upon uninstallation of
            the application. Users maintain full control over their data, including the ability to manage, delete, or
            share the generated 3D models. The user is informed of all data being shared or exported.</p>

        <h2>Third Party Access</h2>
        <p>The application does not utilize third-party services that collect data. We do not share any user information
            with third parties.</p>

        <h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>
        <p>Users can stop using the application at any time by uninstalling it. They may use the standard uninstall
            processes available as part of their mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect any user data externally, there is no data retention policy applicable. All data is
            stored locally on the user's device and can be managed by the user.</p>

        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>The application does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally
            identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of user information. However, since we do not collect
            any data externally, there are no specific security measures applicable.</p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify users of any changes by
            updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. Users are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly
            for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>

        <h2>Your Consent</h2>
        <p>By using the application, users are consenting to the processing of their information as set forth in this
            Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.</p>
