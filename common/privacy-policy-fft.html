        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This privacy policy applies to the mobile application provided by Chenyang Weng (hereby referred to as
            "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>This application utilizes the device's microphone to stream audio for spectrum analysis. The application does
            not save the audio data to the device. The audio data is processed exclusively for the purpose of real-time
            frequency analysis. This data is not used for any other purposes, including but not limited to, recording,
            storage, or marketing. All audio data is processed in real-time and is not transmitted to external servers
            or shared with any third parties. The user retains complete control over the application usage. All data
            processed by this application is temporary and is not stored on the device. Users maintain full control over
            their data, including the ability to manage the application settings. The user is informed of all data being
            processed.</p>

        <h2>Third Party Access</h2>
        <p>The application does not utilize third-party services that collect data. We do not share any user information
            with third parties.</p>

        <h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>
        <p>Users can stop using the application at any time by uninstalling it. They may use the standard uninstall
            processes available as part of their mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect any user data externally, there is no data retention policy applicable. All data is
            processed in real-time and is not stored on the user's device.</p>

        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>The application does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally
            identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of user information. However, since we do not collect
            any data externally, there are no specific security measures applicable.</p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify users of any changes by
            updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. Users are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly
            for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>

        <h2>Your Consent</h2>
        <p>By using the application, users are consenting to the processing of their information as set forth in this
            Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.</p>
